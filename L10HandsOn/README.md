# personalWebSite
## Requirements
To begin, create a new project in your FrontEndFoundations folder named L10HandsOn. You will be responsible for creating the necessary files. Your goal for this project is to create a website that has the following features:

* Layout your page using Flexbox or Bootstrap. 

* Include a header with your name and your job title (ie. Web Developer, Full Stack Developer, etc..)
  An image of yourself so everyone knows who you are.

* If you are uncomfortable including a picture of yourself, please use a placeholder image

* Clickable GitHub icon linking to your GitHub.

* Clickable LinkedIn icon linking to your LinkedIn.

* Clickable icon links to other Social Media sites (ie. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc..)

* Using jQuery, when your icons are hovered over they should transform in size using CSS to show animation.

* List your tech-related skills.

* Dynamically list your GitHub repositories using an AJAX request.
You will need the following API endpoint with your username. https://api.github.com/users/YOURUSERNAME/repos
Hint! Post the above into the web browser and you will see all of your repos listed as a JSON object

* Include a footer that sticks to the bottom of the screen, commonly referred to as a sticky footer.
The footer should contain contact information with an email icon and an email address listed next to it.

Style your page using CSS.
